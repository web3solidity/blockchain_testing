# Blockchain Testing and Solidity Smart Contract Learning

This repository serves as my personal learning and testing ground for **Solidity smart contracts** and **blockchain development**. It contains various examples of **Solidity contracts**, **unit tests**, and **scripts** I use to experiment with blockchain applications.

Feel free to explore, learn from, or contribute to the repository if you're also interested in **Solidity development**, **smart contract testing**, and **blockchain technology**!

## Objective

This repository is dedicated to testing, learning, and experimenting with **Solidity smart contracts**. As I explore blockchain development, I will be:
- Writing smart contracts in Solidity
- Testing them on local testnets (like Ganache or Hardhat)
- Sharing my experiments and findings
- Documenting any challenges and solutions in the learning process

It’s a work in progress, and I invite anyone interested in **blockchain development** to join in, provide feedback, or collaborate!

## Installation

To get started with testing and experimenting with the smart contracts in this repository, follow these installation instructions:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vishwajeeta/blockchain_testing.git
   cd blockchain_testing


## Usage

Once you have cloned the repository and installed the dependencies, you can use the project to interact with the Solidity contracts. Here's a quick guide to get started.

### Running Tests

The primary way to interact with the contracts in this repository is through **unit tests**. To run the test suite, simply run the following command:

```bash
npx hardhat test
